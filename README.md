# A spice affinity chef assistance

A spices-to-spices and spices-to-foods affinity catalogue 
created by [George Kanellopoulos](mailto:g_kanellopoulos@hotmail.com), and implented in VB.Net
by Costas Basdekis.

The content (spices and foods names in the DB) is mainly in Greek,
but the UI has both English and Greek translations, making it usable
by international users, provided they have a DB using their language.
The greek DB may be translate in english some time, while allowing
multiple languages for each item in the DB.
